Experiments with Internet of Things

I have a number of systems that log data to disk.
These include house power consumption, solar power generation,
river levels of a number of UK rivers.

I've been experimenting with the ESP8266 processor running NodeMCA Lua.

I have built a number of JeeNode circuits using the RFM12B 433MHz transcievers.

I needed a way to put all this together. 
So, MQTT (using Mosquitto) and NodeRed.
